# TourOfHeroes7

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.10.

## Command overview for this demo version

- `npm run start`: Start serving the app with development server
- `npm run start:prod`: Start serving the app after production build (requires [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server))
- _IMPORTANT_: The Angular CLI command might not work, since Angular 7 relies of deprecated features of NodeJS. `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` might help!
